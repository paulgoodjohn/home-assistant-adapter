## Hardware
The Home Assistant Adapter consists of a [Xiao ESP32C3](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_ESP32C3_Getting_Started/) and [carrier board](doc/schematic-v1.0.pdf) that breaks out the serial interface of the Xiao to an RJ45 jack.

## Setup
- Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
- Copy `config/Certificate.h.sample` to `config/Certificate.h` and add your certificate (if any)
- Copy `config/Config.h.sample` to `config/Config.h` and add your WiFi credentials, MQTT configuration, and your device ID

In-depth instructions can be found in the [Getting Started](doc/getting-started.md) guide.
